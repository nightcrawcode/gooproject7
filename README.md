# Goo Project 7
A shooter game like splatoon but with tranfur characters. This is a project
for a game i had an idea for, and though it would be fun to make and to also
have more FPS games to play. This project is mostly for me and my freinds to
Play a new FPS game

# How to install
Just download the latest verison from github, extract the contents
then run the executable. (depending on the system it could be a `.exe`, `.app`, `.sh`)

but the game should work from there. if you get any bugs please report it to me
so i can fix it!!! >:3

# Contributing
contributing would be nice. this is just a small projects for a few freinds
but if you really like it then contributing to the code would be the best way
to support this project (as it is only 1 person working on this). it would mean
a lot to me :) owo
